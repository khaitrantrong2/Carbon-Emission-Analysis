Carbon emissions account for over 75% of global emissions and represent a major environmental challenge. These emissions contribute to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to climate change, planetary warming, and various environmental disasters. Identifying sectors with the highest levels of emissions is crucial. By analyzing data across countries and years, we can observe trends and better understand the environmental impact of different industries. This supports informed decision-making in sustainable development.
